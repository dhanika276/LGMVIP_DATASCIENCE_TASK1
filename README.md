Developing a Iris flowers Classification ML Project Iris flower classification refers to the task of categorizing iris flowers into different species based on their features. The iris flower dataset is a well-known and commonly used dataset in machine learning. It contains measurements of four characteristics of iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The flowers in the dataset belong to three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
